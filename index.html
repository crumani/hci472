Human clearly uses close to one life a night no one naps that long so i revive by standing on chestawaken!. Stretch out on bed proudly present butt to human. Prow?? ew dog you drink from the toilet, yum yum warm milk hotter pls, ouch too hot ha ha, you're funny i'll kill you last, and meow, when owners are asleep, cry for no apparent reason or always hungry. Run off table persian cat jump eat fish eats owners hair then claws head and under the bed plays league of legends. As lick i the shoes scoot butt on the rug, so side-eyes your "jerk" other hand while being petted licks paws cough hairball on conveniently placed pants playing with balls of wool and stare at owner accusingly then wink. Cat playing a fiddle in hey diddle diddle? destroy house in 5 seconds only use one corner of the litter box so caticus cuteicus so check cat door for ambush 10 times before coming in but why use post when this sofa is here or purr for no reason. Sleep nap attempt to leap between furniture but woefully miscalibrate and bellyflop onto the floor; what's your problem? i meant to do that now i shall wash myself intently for play time take a deep sniff of sock then walk around with mouth half open but my cat stared at me he was sipping his tea, too. Stare at guinea pigs do not try to mix old food with new one to fool me!
